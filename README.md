### Project Title
Use of Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) R package to impute missing data obtained from a Chicago bike share program

### Description
This project used three different methods to determine how the Multiple Imputation by Chained Equation (MICE) R package performed when imputing sex and age. A subset of anonymized data from the Motivateco bike share program in Chicago was used to perform the analyses, which contained ~20% missing data for age and sex. To reduce computation time, three imputations were performed for each approach and pooled, resulting in one complete dataset for each approach. Each complete dataset was graphed using ggplot2 and analyzed to compare between approaches.

### Files used
chicago.csv #original file
